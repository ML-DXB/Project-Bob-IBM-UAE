# =============================================================================
# NOTES
# =============================================================================
notes: |
  Special considerations for SecureBank:
  
  - All code must remain within SecureBank network (no external AI services)
  - PCI-DSS compliance requirements for payment data handling
  - Code review required before production deployment
  - Security scanning with SonarQube mandatory
  - All API changes require architecture review
  - Audit logging required for all data access
  
  Network setup:
  - VPN required for repository access
  - GitHub Enterprise for version control
  - Jenkins for CI/CD pipeline
  - Artifactory for dependency management
