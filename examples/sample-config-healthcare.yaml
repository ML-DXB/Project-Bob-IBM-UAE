# =============================================================================
# NOTES
# =============================================================================
notes: |
  Special considerations for HealthTech:
  
  - HIPAA compliance is mandatory for all PHI handling
  - All patient data must be encrypted at rest and in transit
  - Audit logging required for all PHI access
  - FHIR R4 standard compliance required
  - BAA (Business Associate Agreement) in place
  - Regular security audits and penetration testing
  
  Healthcare-specific requirements:
  - HL7 FHIR resource validation
  - SMART on FHIR authentication
  - Clinical terminology (SNOMED CT, LOINC, RxNorm)
  - Interoperability with other EHR systems
  - Patient consent management
  - Clinical decision support integration
  
  Development environment:
  - Azure-based infrastructure
  - PostgreSQL for patient data
  - Redis for caching and sessions
  - RabbitMQ for async tasks
  - GitHub Actions for CI/CD
