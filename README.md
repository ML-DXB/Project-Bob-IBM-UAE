### Examples
- **`examples/`** - Sample configurations for different industries

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option A: Use the Bobathon Builder Mode (Recommended)

The easiest way to create a customized bobathon is using the **Bobathon Builder** mode, which guides you through an interactive Q&A process.

**📖 [Read the Bobathon Builder Guide](BOBATHON_BUILDER_GUIDE.md)** for complete installation and usage instructions.

**Quick Start:**
1. Open this project in VS Code with Bob
2. Switch to "🎓 Bobathon Builder" mode
3. Say: "Help me create a new bobathon for [Client Name]"
4. Answer the guided questions
5. Bob will generate and validate all materials

### Option B: Manual Configuration

If you prefer to manually edit the configuration:

#### 1. Clone or Copy This Template
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd bob_client_bobathon_starter
```

#### 2. Customize the Configuration
Edit `bobathon-config.yaml` with your client's information:

```yaml
client:
  name: "Acme Corporation"
  market: "Financial Services"

technologies:
  primary_language: "Python"
  frameworks: ["Django", "React"]
  infrastructure: "AWS"

use_cases:
  - name: "API Development"
    description: "Build RESTful APIs faster"
    priority: "high"
```

#### 3. Prepare Lab Materials
Customize the lab exercises in the `labs/` directory based on your client's:
- Technology stack
- Use cases
- Skill level
- Actual codebase

**Tip:** You can ask Bob to help customize labs even without using the Bobathon Builder mode.

#### 4. Review the Schedule
Check `schedule/detailed-agenda.md` and adjust timing if needed:
- Compress for half-day format (3 hours)
- Expand for two-day format (12 hours)
- Adjust for virtual vs. in-person delivery

### 5. Deliver the Bobathon
Follow the detailed agenda and use Bob to demonstrate capabilities in real-time.

## 📖 Detailed Instructions

### Customizing for Your Client

#### Step 1: Gather Client Information
Before customizing the template, collect:
- Client name and industry
- Technology stack and tools
- Key pain points and use cases
- Team size and skill levels
- Available time and format preferences

#### Step 2: Update bobathon-config.yaml
This is the most important file. Bob will read this to understand the client context.

**Required Sections:**
- `client` - Basic client information
- `technologies` - Tech stack details
- `use_cases` - Specific scenarios to address
- `schedule` - Timing and agenda

**Optional Sections:**
- `resources` - External documentation and APIs
- `participants` - Team composition
- `success_criteria` - Measurable outcomes
- `follow_up` - Post-bobathon support plan

#### Step 3: Customize Lab Exercises

**Lab 1: Basic Operations (30 minutes)**
- Keep this generic but use client's tech stack
- Focus on fundamental Bob commands
- Ensure everyone completes successfully

**Lab 2: Advanced Workflows (30 minutes)**
- Introduce complexity gradually
- Use realistic scenarios from client's domain
- Include debugging and refactoring

**Lab 3: Client-Specific (90 minutes)**
- Use actual client codebase if possible
- Address real problems from their backlog
- Demonstrate tangible value and ROI

#### Step 4: Prepare Resources
- Update cheat sheet with client-specific examples
- Add troubleshooting for client's environment
- Curate external links relevant to their stack

## 🌟 Bob's Unique Differentiators

Understanding what makes Bob unique helps you deliver more impactful bobathons. Bob stands out in four key areas:

### 1. 🔧 Extensible Architecture
- **Custom Modes**: Tailor AI behavior for specific workflows (Code, Ask, Plan, or create your own)
- **MCP Server Integration**: Connect external tools and services directly into development workflow
- **Marketplace**: Share and discover custom modes created by the community

### 2. 🧠 Intelligent Resource Optimization
- **Automatic Model Selection**: Bob chooses the right AI model for each task (Frontier-class for complex, lighter for simple)
- **Dynamic Context Management**: Efficient compression and prioritization reduces costs by up to 60%
- **Transparent Operation**: No cognitive load of choosing models yourself

### 3. 🔍 Bob Findings: Automated Analysis
- **Security Scanning**: Continuous vulnerability detection with remediation recommendations
- **Code Quality**: Intelligent refactoring suggestions to reduce technical debt
- **Compliance**: Enforcement of best practices across your codebase
- **Proactive**: Catches issues before they reach production

### 4. ☕ Enterprise Java Modernization
- **Deep Integration**: Works with IBM's Application Modernization Accelerator
- **J2EE to Liberty**: Automated migration with minimal manual intervention
- **Version Upgrades**: Seamless Java version migrations (8 → 11 → 17 → 21)
- **Beyond Java**: Can modernize other languages too (Python, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, .NET)

**📖 For complete details, see [`resources/bob-differentiators.md`](resources/bob-differentiators.md)**

### Why This Matters for Your Bobathon

When delivering bobathons, emphasize these differentiators:
- **Morning Session**: Introduce modes, Bob Findings, and literate coding
- **Advanced Session**: Demonstrate MCP integrations and intelligent optimization
