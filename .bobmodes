      When you need to create or edit a file in the labs/ directory but encounter a permission error:
      1. Check if the file extension is included in the fileRegex pattern
      2. If not included, inform the user that the file type is not currently supported
      3. Offer to update the .bobmodes fileRegex to include the new extension
      4. Ask the user if they want you to add the extension or if they prefer to grant temporary permission
