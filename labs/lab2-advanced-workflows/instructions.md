- Use advanced editing techniques
- Manage complex tasks with todo lists

## 📋 Setup

Before starting, ensure you have:
- [ ] Completed Lab 1
- [ ] Bob running in your IDE
- [ ] Access to the sample project with multiple files
- [ ] Understanding of basic Bob tools

## 🔨 Exercises

### Exercise 1: Multi-File Refactoring (10 minutes)

**Scenario:** You need to rename a function that's used across multiple files and update all references.

**Tasks:**
1. Find all files that use the function `getUserData`
2. Rename the function to `fetchUserProfile` in the main file
3. Update all import statements and function calls
4. Verify the changes with tests

**Bob Tools to Use:**
- `search_files` - Find all usages
- `read_file` - Review multiple files at once
- `apply_diff` - Make precise changes in each file
- `execute_command` - Run tests

**Example Prompt:**
```
I need to refactor the getUserData function to fetchUserProfile. First, search for all files that use getUserData. Then read those files, update the function definition and all calls to it, and run the tests to verify everything still works.
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- Function renamed in definition file
- All references updated across the codebase
- Tests pass successfully
- No broken imports or calls

**Key Learning:**
- How to coordinate changes across multiple files
- Importance of searching before modifying
- Verifying changes with tests

### Exercise 2: Feature Implementation (10 minutes)

**Scenario:** Add a new feature that requires changes to multiple files: model, controller, and tests.

**Tasks:**
1. Add a new field to a data model
2. Update the controller to handle the new field
3. Create tests for the new functionality
4. Update documentation

**Bob Tools to Use:**
- `list_code_definition_names` - Understand existing structure
- `read_file` - Review related files together
- `apply_diff` - Make targeted changes
- `insert_content` - Add new test cases
- `update_todo_list` - Track progress

**Example Prompt:**
```
I need to add an "email" field to the User model. Please:
1. Update the User class in models/user.py
2. Modify the UserController to validate and save email
3. Add tests for email validation
4. Update the API documentation

Create a todo list to track this work.
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- Model updated with new field
- Controller handles the field correctly
- Tests cover the new functionality
- Documentation reflects changes
- Todo list shows completed steps

**Key Learning:**
- Breaking down complex features into steps
- Using todo lists for task management
- Coordinating related changes
- Importance of tests and documentation

### Exercise 3: Debugging and Troubleshooting (5 minutes)

**Scenario:** Tests are failing and you need to identify and fix the issue.

**Tasks:**
1. Run the failing test suite
2. Analyze the error messages
3. Locate the problematic code
4. Fix the issue
5. Verify the fix

**Bob Tools to Use:**
- `execute_command` - Run tests
- `search_files` - Find related code
- `read_file` - Examine the problematic area
- `apply_diff` - Fix the issue

**Example Prompt:**
```
Run the test suite and help me debug any failures. Analyze the error messages, find the problematic code, explain what's wrong, and fix it.
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- Tests run and failures identified
- Root cause understood
- Issue fixed correctly
- All tests passing

**Key Learning:**
- Systematic debugging approach
- Reading and interpreting error messages
- Using Bob to trace issues
- Verifying fixes

### Exercise 4: Code Quality Improvement (5 minutes)

**Scenario:** Refactor code to improve readability, performance, or maintainability.

**Tasks:**
1. Identify code that needs improvement
2. Refactor for better quality
3. Ensure functionality remains the same
4. Add comments or documentation

**Bob Tools to Use:**
- `read_file` - Analyze current code
- `apply_diff` - Make improvements
- `execute_command` - Run tests to verify

**Example Prompt:**
```
Review the calculate_statistics function in utils/analytics.py. Refactor it to be more readable and efficient. Add docstrings and comments. Make sure all tests still pass.
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- Code is more readable
- Performance improved (if applicable)
- Better documentation
- Tests still pass
- No functionality broken

**Key Learning:**
- Refactoring without breaking functionality
- Balancing readability and performance
- Importance of tests during refactoring
- Adding helpful documentation

## 🎓 Advanced Techniques

### 1. Leveraging Bob Modes in Complex Workflows

As tasks get more complex, using the right mode becomes even more important:

**Strategic Mode Switching:**
```
[Ask Mode] - Understand the problem
"Explain the current authentication architecture and identify potential issues"

[Plan Mode] - Break down the solution
"Create a detailed plan to migrate from session-based to JWT authentication"

[Code Mode] - Implement step by step
"Implement step 1: Add JWT library and configuration"
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Ask Mode gives you deep understanding without making changes
- Plan Mode helps you think through complex changes before coding
- Code Mode focuses on implementation with full context

**Pro Tip:** Use Plan mode to create a todo list, then work through it in Code mode.

### 2. Using Bob Findings in Refactoring

Before refactoring, ask Bob to analyze the code:

```
"Analyze this module for security issues, code quality problems, and refactoring opportunities. Prioritize by severity."
```

**Bob Findings Will Identify:**
- Security vulnerabilities to fix first
- Code smells to address
- Performance bottlenecks
- Maintainability issues

**Then refactor with confidence:**
```
"Refactor this module addressing the high-priority findings you identified, starting with security issues."
```

### 3. Reading Multiple Files Efficiently

When working with related files, read them together:

```
Read these files together:
- src/models/user.py
- src/controllers/user_controller.py
- tests/test_user.py

I need to understand how user authentication works.
```

**Benefits:**
- Bob gets full context
- Better understanding of relationships
- More accurate suggestions

### 2. Using Line Ranges for Large Files

For large files, read specific sections:

```
Read src/app.py lines 1-50 and 200-250 to see the initialization and main function.
```

**Benefits:**
- Faster reading
- Focus on relevant code
- Reduced token usage

### 3. Complex apply_diff Operations

Make multiple changes in one request:

```
In src/utils.py, make these changes:
1. Update the calculate_total function to add tax
2. Add a new format_currency helper function
3. Fix the typo in the comment on line 45
```

**Benefits:**
- Atomic changes
- Fewer round trips
- Better context preservation

### 4. Using Todo Lists for Complex Tasks

Break down large tasks:

```
Create a todo list for implementing user authentication:
- [ ] Add User model with password hashing
- [ ] Create login endpoint
- [ ] Add JWT token generation
- [ ] Implement middleware for protected routes
- [ ] Add tests for auth flow
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear progress tracking
- Organized approach
- Easy to resume if interrupted

## 🐛 Common Challenges

### Challenge: Changes conflict with each other
**Solution:** Make changes in logical order, test incrementally

### Challenge: Lost track of what needs to be done
**Solution:** Use `update_todo_list` to track progress

### Challenge: Tests failing after refactoring
**Solution:** Make smaller changes, test more frequently

### Challenge: Unsure about the impact of changes
**Solution:** Search for all usages first, read related code

### Challenge: Complex changes feel overwhelming
**Solution:** Break into smaller steps, tackle one at a time
