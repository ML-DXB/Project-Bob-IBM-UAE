## 🔨 Exercises

### Exercise 1: File Navigation and Reading (5 minutes)

**Scenario:** You've just joined a project and need to understand the codebase structure.

**Tasks:**
1. List all files in the project directory
2. Read the main configuration file
3. Identify the entry point of the application

**Bob Tools to Use:**
- `list_files` - To see directory structure
- `read_file` - To view file contents

**Example Prompt:**
```
Please list all files in the current directory recursively, then read the main configuration file.
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- You can see the project structure
- You understand where key files are located
- You've read at least one configuration file

**💡 Real-time Value Indicator:**
Notice how Bob reads and displays file contents in seconds, compared to manually navigating through multiple directories and opening files. This saves approximately 2-3 minutes per exploration task.

### Exercise 2: Code Search and Discovery (5 minutes)

**Scenario:** You need to find all places where a specific function is called.

**Tasks:**
1. Search for all TODO comments in the codebase
2. Find all files that import a specific module
3. Locate a function definition by name

**Bob Tools to Use:**
- `search_files` - To find patterns across files
- `list_code_definition_names` - To see function/class names

**Example Prompt:**

**Tasks:**
1. Update a configuration value in a JSON/YAML file
2. Fix a typo in a function name
3. Add a new import statement to a file

**Bob Tools to Use:**
- `write_to_file` - For complete file rewrites (small files)
- `apply_diff` - For targeted changes (preferred)
- `insert_content` - For adding new lines

**Example Prompt:**
```
In the config.json file, change the "debug" value from false to true. Then in src/app.py, fix the typo in the function name "calcualte_total" to "calculate_total".
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- Configuration value updated correctly
- Typo fixed without breaking other code
- You understand the difference between editing tools

---

### Exercise 4: Command Execution (5 minutes)

- read_file
- list_files
- search_files
- list_code_definition_names

Require manual approval for:
- write_to_file
- apply_diff
- execute_command
- insert_content
```

**Expected Outcome:**
