# Bobathon Builder Mode - Installation and Usage Guide

## 🎯 Overview

The **Bobathon Builder** mode is a custom Bob mode that guides you through creating customized bobathons for clients. It provides:

- **Interactive Q&A** to gather client information
- **Automatic validation** to ensure completeness
- **Smart customization** of labs and materials
- **Quality assurance** checks before delivery

## 📦 Installation

The Bobathon Builder mode is already included in this template! The mode configuration is in the `.bobmodes` file at the root of this project.

### Verify Installation

1. Open this project in VS Code with Bob installed
2. Look for the mode selector in Bob's interface
3. You should see "🎓 Bobathon Builder" in the list of available modes

### If the Mode Doesn't Appear

If you don't see the Bobathon Builder mode:

1. **Reload VS Code Window:**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
   - Type "Reload Window" and press Enter
   - Bob will reload and detect the `.bobmodes` file

2. **Check the .bobmodes file:**
   - Ensure `.bobmodes` exists in the workspace root
   - Verify it contains the `bobathon-builder` mode configuration

3. **Restart Bob:**
   - Close and reopen VS Code
   - Bob should detect the custom mode on startup

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Switch to Bobathon Builder Mode

1. Open Bob in VS Code
2. Click the mode selector (shows current mode like "💻 Code" or "❓ Ask")
3. Select "🎓 Bobathon Builder" from the list

### Step 2: Start Creating a Bobathon

Once in Bobathon Builder mode, you can:

**Option A: Create from Scratch**
```
Help me create a new bobathon for [Client Name]
```

**Option B: Start from an Example**
```
I want to create a bobathon based on the Financial Services example
```

**Option C: Customize Existing Config**
```
Customize the labs for the client in bobathon-config.yaml
```

### Step 3: Answer the Questions

Bob will guide you through a series of questions:

1. **Client Information**
   - Company name and industry
   - Primary contact details

2. **Technology Stack**
   - Programming language
   - Frameworks and tools
   - Infrastructure (AWS, Azure, etc.)

3. **Lab Technology Preference**
   - Should Labs 1 & 2 (basic Bob features) use the same technology as the client?
   - Or use generic examples that work across languages?
   - This helps ensure labs are relevant to the client's daily work

4. **Use Cases**
   - What problems to solve
   - Priority levels
   - Time estimates

5. **Schedule**
   - Total duration (3, 6, or 12 hours)
   - Date and timezone
   - Timing preferences

6. **Participants**
   - Team size
   - Roles and skill levels
   - Prerequisites

### Step 4: Review and Validate

After gathering information, Bob will:
- Generate `bobathon-config.yaml`
- Validate completeness
- Check for consistency
- Offer to customize labs

### Step 5: Customize Materials

Choose what to customize:
- **Lab 1:** Basic operations for their tech stack
- **Lab 2:** Advanced workflows for their tech stack
- **Lab 3:** Client-specific scenarios based on use cases
- **Schedule:** Detailed agenda with timing

### Step 6: Save Your Bobathon

Once everything is complete and validated, Bob will ask how you want to save the bobathon:

**Option 1: Export to New Directory (Recommended)**
- Creates a clean, standalone bobathon in `../{client-name}-bobathon/`
- Optionally removes template files (.bob/, .bobmodes, examples/)
- Ready to initialize as a new git repository
- Perfect for client delivery

**Option 2: Prepare for New Repository**
- Creates a branch with your changes
- Asks for target repository URL
- Provides exact git commands to push
- Optionally cleans up template files

**Option 3: Create Branch in This Repo**
- Keeps bobathon with template for easy updates
- Creates branch like `bobathon-acme-corp`
- All bobathons in one repository
- Easy to switch between clients

**Option 4: Commit to Current Branch**
- Simple commit to current branch
- You handle git workflow manually
- Good for quick iterations

## 📋 Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Complete New Bobathon Setup

```
User: "Create a new bobathon for Acme Financial Services"

Bob will ask about:
1. Industry and contact info
2. Tech stack (Java, Spring Boot, etc.)
3. Lab technology preference:
   "Should Labs 1 & 2 use Java/Spring Boot like your client work,
    or generic examples? Using client tech makes labs more relevant
    but takes more customization time."
4. Key use cases (API development, security, etc.)
5. Duration and schedule
6. Team composition
7. Business value tracking preferences

Then Bob will:
- Generate bobathon-config.yaml
- Customize labs based on technology preference

### 7. Business Value Tracking
**Set up business value tracking when:**
- You want to demonstrate ROI to stakeholders
- Client needs metrics for adoption decisions
- You're measuring bobathon effectiveness
- Building case studies for future clients

**Collection strategy:**
- **Comprehensive** (recommended): After each lab + end of bobathon + 2-4 week follow-up
- **Balanced**: After each lab + end of bobathon
- **Minimal**: End of bobathon only

**Metrics to capture:**
- Time savings (hours/week)
- Quality improvements (% bugs caught)
- Security enhancements (vulnerabilities prevented)
- Cost savings ($ per month)
- Adoption rate (% of team using Bob)
- Ease of use (1-5 scale)
- Likelihood to adopt (1-5 scale)

   git commit -m "Initial bobathon for Acme Corp"
   git remote add origin [your-url]
   git push -u origin main
```

**Example: Prepare for New Repository**
```
Bob: "What's the target repository URL?"
User: "https://github.com/myorg/acme-bobathon.git"

Bob: "Remove template files?"
User: "Yes"

Bob will:
1. Create branch bobathon-acme-corp
2. Remove template files
3. Commit changes
4. Provide commands:
   git remote add acme https://github.com/myorg/acme-bobathon.git
   git push acme bobathon-acme-corp:main
```
```

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### 1. Be Specific
Instead of: "Create a bobathon"
Try: "Create a bobathon for a healthcare client using Python and Django"

### 2. Use the Suggestions
Bob provides 2-4 suggestions for each question - use them to save time!

### 3. Start from Examples
If your client is similar to an example, start there:
- Financial Services → `examples/sample-config-fintech.yaml`
- Healthcare → `examples/sample-config-healthcare.yaml`

### 4. Choose Lab Technology Wisely
**Use client technology for Labs 1 & 2 when:**
- Client uses a specific, less common language/framework
- Team is new to their tech stack and needs practice
- You have time for full customization
- Examples in client's tech will be more engaging

**Use generic examples when:**
- Client uses common languages (Python, JavaScript, Java)
- Time is limited (3-hour bobathon)
- Focus is on Bob concepts, not language specifics
- Team is experienced with their stack

### 5. Code Generation Options
**Generate both starter code and solutions (recommended) when:**
- You want a complete, ready-to-deliver bobathon
- Facilitators need reference implementations
- Participants benefit from seeing working examples
- Time allows for code review and customization

**Generate starter code only when:**
- You want participants to build solutions during the bobathon
- Focus is on learning by doing
- Facilitators are comfortable creating solutions on the fly

**Skip code generation when:**
- You have existing code samples to use
- Labs will use client's actual codebase
- You prefer to create code manually

### 6. Validate Before Delivery
Always run validation before considering the bobathon complete:
```
Validate the bobathon materials and fix any issues
```

### 6. Iterate as Needed
You can always ask Bob to adjust:
```
The Lab 3 scenarios are too complex, simplify them
Add more time to the API development use case
Change the tech stack from Java to Python
```

## 🎓 Understanding the Mode

### What the Mode Can Do

✅ **Read and analyze:**
- Bobathon configuration
- Lab instructions
- Schedule files
- Example configs
- Resource files

✅ **Edit and create:**
- `bobathon-config.yaml`
- Lab instructions (`labs/*.md`)
- Schedule files (`schedule/*.md`)
- Example configs (`examples/*.yaml`)
- Resource files (`resources/*.md`)

✅ **Execute commands:**
- Validation scripts
- File operations
- Testing commands

### What the Mode Cannot Do

❌ **Cannot edit:**
- Files outside the bobathon template
- System files
- Unrelated project files

❌ **Cannot access:**
- External APIs (unless via MCP)
- Network resources
- Browser actions

### Mode Restrictions

The mode is restricted to bobathon-related files for safety:
- Prevents accidental changes to other files
- Ensures focus on bobathon preparation
- Maintains template integrity

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Mode Not Appearing

**Solution:**
1. Verify `.bobmodes` file exists in workspace root
2. Reload VS Code window
3. Check Bob is properly installed and activated

### Issue: Bob Asks Too Many Questions

**Solution:**
- This is intentional! The mode gathers complete information upfront
- Use the suggestions to answer quickly
- You can provide multiple answers at once:
  ```
  Client: Acme Corp, Financial Services
  Tech: Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL
  Use cases: API development, security compliance, testing
  ```

### Issue: Generated Config Has Errors

**Solution:**
1. Ask Bob to validate: "Validate the bobathon materials"
2. Bob will identify and fix issues
3. Review the validation report

### Issue: Labs Don't Match Tech Stack

**Solution:**
```
The labs still use Python but our client uses Java. 
Please update all labs to use Java and Spring Boot.
```

### Issue: Timing Doesn't Fit

**Solution:**
```
We have 4 hours instead of 6. Adjust the schedule and 
prioritize the high-priority use cases.
```
